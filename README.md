## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Choose a Question
Open any file (e.g., `File1_Q1_FamilyPhotograph.java`)

### Step 2: Read the Problem
Each file contains:
- ✅ Problem statement
- ✅ Classification (Array, Stack, etc.)
- ✅ Test cases with expected outputs
- ✅ Algorithm hint
- ✅ Similar questions for more practice

### Step 3: Implement Your Solution
Find the `// YOUR CODE HERE` sections and write your solution.
